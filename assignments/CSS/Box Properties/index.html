    <p> A puppy is a juvenile dog, generally one less than 12-18 months old. Puppies are markedly underdeveloped and
        dependent on their mothers at birth (displaying altriciality), but healthy puppies grow quickly and begin
        walking thereafter. Puppies generally weigh 8–16 oz (0.23–0.45 kg) shortly after birth, depending on the
        breed.<img src="images/puppy.webp" alt=""> A puppy's coat color may change as the puppy grows older, as is commonly
        seen in breeds such as the Yorkshire Terrier. Puppy refers specifically to young dogs, while pup may be used for
        other animals such as wolves, seals, giraffes, guinea pigs, rats or sharks. Puppies are born after an average of
        63 days of gestation, emerging in an amnion that is bitten off and eaten by the mother dog. Puppies begin to
        nurse almost immediately. If the litter exceeds six puppies, particularly if one or more are obvious runts,
        human intervention in hand-feeding the stronger puppies is necessary to ensure that the runts get proper
        nourishment and attention from the mother. As they reach one month of age, puppies are gradually weaned and
        begin to eat solid food. The mother may regurgitate partially digested food for the puppies or might let them
        eat some of her solid food. The mother usually refuses to nurse at this stage, though she might let them
        occasionally nurs for comfort. At first, puppies spend the large majority of their time sleeping and the rest
        feeding. They instinctively pile together into a heap, and become distressed if separated from physical contact
        with their littermates by even a short distance. Puppies are born with a fully functional sense of smell. They
        are unable to open their eyes. During their first two weeks, a puppy's senses all develop rapidly. During this
        stage the nose is the primary sense organ used by puppies to find their mother's teats, and to locate their
        littermates, if they become separated by a short distance. Puppies open their eyes about nine to eleven days
        following birth. At first, their retinas are poorly developed and their vision is poor. Puppies are not able to
        see as well as adult dogs. In addition, puppies' ears remain sealed until about thirteen to seventeen days after
        birth, after which they respond more actively to sounds. Between two and four weeks old, puppies usually begin
        to growl, bite, wag their tails, and bark. </p>

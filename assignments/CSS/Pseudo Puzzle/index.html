                <p>The City of London, also known as the City, is a city, ceremonial county and local government
                    district that contains the ancient centre, and constitutes, along with Canary Wharf, the primary
                    central business district (CBD) of London and one of the leading financial centres of the world. It
                    constituted most of London from its settlement by the Romans in the 1st century AD to the Middle
                    Ages,
                    but the modern area referred to as London has since grown far beyond the City of London boundary.
                    The City is now only a small part of the metropolis of Greater London, though it remains a notable
                    part
                    of central London. The City of London is not one of the London boroughs, a status reserved for the
                    other
                    32 districts (including Greater London's only other city, the City of Westminster). It is also a
                    separate ceremonial county, being an enclave surrounded by the ceremonial county of Greater London,
                    and
                    is the smallest ceremonial county in England.</p>

                <p>The City of London is known colloquially as the Square Mile, as it is 1.12 sq mi (716.80 acres; 2.90
                    km2) in area. Both the terms the City and the Square Mile are often used as metonyms for the UK's
                    trading and financial services industries, which continue a notable history of being largely based
                    in
                    the City. The name London is now ordinarily used for a far wider area than just the City. London
                    most
                    often denotes the sprawling London metropolis, or the 32 Greater London boroughs, in addition to the
                    City of London itself. The local authority for the City, the City of London Corporation, is unique
                    in
                    the UK and has some unusual responsibilities for a local council, such as being the police
                    authority,
                    and in having responsibilities and ownerships beyond its boundaries, e.g. Hampstead Heath. The
                    corporation is headed by the Lord Mayor of the City of London (an office separate from, and much
                    older
                    than, the Mayor of London). The current Lord Mayor is Alastair King. The City is made up of 25
                    wards,
                    with administration at the historic Guildhall.</p>

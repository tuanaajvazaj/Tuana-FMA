            <article>Nature is an inherent character or constitution, particularly of the ecosphere or the universe as a
                whole. In this general sense nature refers to the laws, elements and phenomena of the physical world,
                including life. Although humans are part of nature, human activity or humans as a whole are often
                described as at times at odds, or outright separate and even superior to nature.</article>

            <article>During the advent of modern scientific method in the last several centuries, nature became the
                passive reality, organized and moved by divine laws. With the Industrial Revolution, nature increasingly
                became seen as the part of reality deprived from intentional intervention: it was hence considered as
                sacred by some traditions (Rousseau, American transcendentalism) or a mere decorum for divine providence
                or human history (Hegel, Marx). However, a vitalist vision of nature, closer to the pre-Socratic one,
                got reborn at the same time, especially after Charles Darwin.</article>

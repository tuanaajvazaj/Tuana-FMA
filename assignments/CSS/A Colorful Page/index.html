                <p>Nature is an inherent character or constitution, particularly of the ecosphere or the universe as a
                    whole. In this general sense nature refers to the laws, elements and phenomena of the physical
                    world, including life. Although humans are part of nature, human activity or humans as a whole are
                    often described as at times at odds, or outright separate and even superior to nature.</p>

                <p>During the advent of modern scientific method in the last several centuries, nature became the
                    passive reality, organized and moved by divine laws. With the Industrial Revolution, nature
                    increasingly became seen as the part of reality deprived from intentional intervention: it was hence
                    considered as sacred by some traditions (Rousseau, American transcendentalism) or a mere decorum for
                    divine providence or human history (Hegel, Marx).</p>

                <h1>Project 1- Favorite Celebrity</h1>
            </article>
            <article>My first project is <u>"Favorite Celebrity".</u> In this project I talked about Eminem, first in
                the
                <strong>header</strong> I wrote his name Eminem. Than in the <strong>main part</strong>, in the
                <strong>first section </strong>I described who he is and
                what he does and I added 2 photos of him. In the <strong>second section</strong> I wrote about his most
                famous album. In
                the <strong>third section</strong> I wrote his most famous songs and I added a link to Youtube for the
                song "Lose
                Yourself". Than In the other section I did an order list for my favorite songs of Eminem and for the
                song "The way I am" I embed a YouTube video using <strong>IFrame.</strong> And I also embed an audio
                file for the song
                "Beautiful" using the <strong>audio element</strong>.In the last section I wrote about his new album and
                I added a photo
                which when you click it sends you to the wikipedia page that described the album.

            </article>
            <article>My second project is <u>"Three Tables".</u> In this project I did three simple tables using
                elements like
                <u>tables, tr, td and th.</u> The first table was a <strong>Multiplication Table.</strong> First I used
                the <strong>table element</strong> Inside
                it I did <strong>3 table rows</strong> with the element <strong>tr</strong>, in the first table row I
                had
                <strong>3 table headings(th)</strong>, in the
                second and third table row I had <strong>1 table heading (th)</strong> and <strong>2 table data
                    (td)</strong>. The second table was <strong>"Invoice"</strong> , first I used the <strong>table
                    element </strong>than inside it I did
                <strong>5 table rows (tr)</strong>. In the first table row I did <strong>2 table headings</strong> with
                the element <strong>th.</strong> Than in the second, third and fourth row I added <strong>2 table
                    data</strong> in each with the element <strong>td</strong>, and
                in the fifth row I did <strong>2 table headings (th)</strong> . The third table was a table that I
                talked about myself. First I used the <strong>table element</strong> than inside it I added <strong>3
                    table rows</strong> and in each of them I used <strong>1 table heading(th) and 1 table
                    data(td).</strong> Also on the first table row in td I added a link for YouTube.

            </article>
            <article>My third project is <strong>"Register and Log In Form"</strong>. In this project I made 2 files (
                login.html and register.html ). So in the first file I did a <u>Login In form.</u> Firstly I used the
                <strong>Form Element</strong> than I made a label for <strong>email</strong> and an input type
                <strong>email.</strong> Than I also made a
                label for <strong>password</strong> and an input tybe <strong>password.</strong> After that I made an
                input type <strong>submit</strong>.
                Lastly if you didn't have an account I added an <strong>a-href element</strong> that sends you to the
                file <strong>register.html</strong>
                and you could register there if you didn't have an account.

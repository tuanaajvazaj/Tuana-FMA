    <p> A puppy is a juvenile dog, generally one less than 12-18 months old. Puppies are markedly underdeveloped and
        dependent on their mothers at birth (displaying altriciality), but
        healthy puppies grow quickly and begin walking thereafter. <img src="puppy.webp" alt="" > Puppies
        generally weigh 8–16 oz (0.23–0.45 kg)
        shortly after birth, depending on the breed. A puppy's coat color may change as the puppy grows older, as is
        commonly seen in breeds such as the Yorkshire Terrier. Puppy refers specifically to young dogs, while pup may be
        used for other animals such as wolves,
        seals, giraffes, guinea pigs, rats or sharks. Puppies are born after an average of 63 days of gestation,
        emerging in an amnion that is bitten off and eaten by the mother dog. Puppies begin to nurse almost
        immediately. If the litter exceeds six puppies, particularly if one or more are obvious runts, human
        intervention in hand-feeding the stronger puppies is necessary to ensure that the runts get proper nourishment
        and attention from the mother. As they reach one month of age, puppies are gradually weaned and begin to eat
        solid food. The mother may regurgitate partially digested food for the puppies or might let them eat some of her
        solid food. The mother usually refuses to nurse at this stage, though she might let them occasionally nurse
        for comfort. At first, puppies spend the large majority of their time sleeping and the rest feeding. They
        instinctively pile together into a heap, and become distressed if separated from physical contact with their
        littermates by even a short distance. Puppies are born with a fully functional sense of smell. They are unable to open their eyes. During their first
        two weeks, a puppy's senses all develop rapidly. </p>
